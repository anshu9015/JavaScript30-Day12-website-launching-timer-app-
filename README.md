🌟🚀 Day 12 of My JavaScript Journey: Crafting a "Launching Soon" Page with Interval Mastery!
Today was all about creating anticipation and excitement with a "Launching Soon" webpage. Here's what I accomplished:
🔵 SetInterval Method: I harnessed the power of the setInterval method to create countdown timers and dynamically update page elements.
🔴 ClearInterval Function: I learned how to use the clearInterval function to halt and reset timers when needed, ensuring precise control over the countdown.
🚀 Join me in the countdown to something amazing!
